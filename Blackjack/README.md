# 🃏 Blackjack Game (Python)

Welcome to the **Blackjack Game**, a simple console-based implementation of the classic card game **Blackjack (21)** built using Python. This project demonstrates the use of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts such as classes, objects, and methods.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

Blackjack is a popular casino card game where the goal is to have a hand value closer to **21** than the dealer’s hand **without exceeding it**.  
This program simulates a basic version of the game where:
- You play against the computer (dealer).
- Aces can count as **1 or 11**.
- The dealer hits until reaching **17** or higher.
- You can **Hit** or **Stand** during your turn.

## 🧱 Features

✅ Full deck and card handling  
✅ Player and dealer hands  
✅ Betting system with chips  
✅ Input validation for bets and choices  
✅ Automatic handling of Ace values  
✅ Option to play multiple rounds

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming**
  - Classes: `Card`, `Deck`, `Hand`, `Chips`
  - Encapsulation and methods
- **Randomization** (shuffling cards)
- **Control Flow & Loops**
- **User Input Handling**
- **Basic Game Logic**
